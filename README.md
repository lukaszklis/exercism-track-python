Hello, I’m Łukasz. 👋

I’m a Computer Science (BSc) student at the [WSB Universities](https://wsb.pl/english/). This repository is a collection of solutions submitted to the [Python track on Exercism][solutions] which I’m using to learn basics of the language and practice more before taking exams in the classes.

## Found Issues?

Feel free to open [a new issue][new-issue] and/or [a Pull Request][new-pr], or add comments to my solutions [directly on Exercism][solutions]. Thank you in advance for your help! 💙
